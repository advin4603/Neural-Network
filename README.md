# Neural-Network
Implementation of a neural network from scratch in python using numpy. Implemented features include Cross Entropy, L2-Regularization, Quadratic Cost, and sigmoid layers. Inspired by the book [Neural networks and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html).

## Requirements
- python 3.8+
- numpy
- [alive-progress](https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress) (to run main.py)

## Run
Run the following to train and save a model which can classify handwritten digits from the MNIST handwritten digit database.
```bash
python main.py
```
